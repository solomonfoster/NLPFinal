Hahah all good
I recognize that area code anyway
The groupme link won't let me in and idk who has mobile slack

Could you add me?
thank yyyooouuuu
Not sure whether I'm going out of town tn or tomorrow early so if I leave tomorrow I'll try to make it
Fair,  it's definitely a little bonus
All set thank you 
I'll split it
I can Venmo you
I gotchu don't worry. Yeah that's ridiculous
I'm paying credit card bills right now but as soon as the paycheck deposits I promise I will Venmo you
Hahah they look enormous
Thanks for spotting it 
Also I sorta faded in and out towards the end of last night so sorry if I was a pain in the ass at any point
Hahaha good thank you 
Nice
!!
But again
Weird you're getting ads
Yeah I'm debating just bringing something to eat or picking something up
I'd be down
Have you tried the track at austin HS
behind zilker?
I see people on it now and there are tires n shit
And pull up bars and stuff like that
At some point definitely
Some horrible sprint/pull-up/etc circuit 
Short sweet and brutal 
But-- only in the morning
It looked like there were random people on it
So I'd guess it's ok
Total accident
But definitely promising
Yeah
Might not be worth it unless you wanna try things on
It's small
But I love their stuff
Kk I feel ya
Yeah
is 7 ok
Okay sounds good then
üëåüèº
Parked not far walking down
Have you left?
üëåüèº
Onward 
To work
 Sure
Did you want to try something new or get bowls again
I'm down for either 
It's either bowls or tacos 
Down
Seriously no need to thank me, always happy to listen
You obviously needed to think some stuff over
Did you want to do 7 again 
Good with me
Grabbing a muscle milk at 711 do you want one
Both look good

Down for whateva
I've seen modern market not sure where Texas honey ham is
I'll eat anything ahah
Ooh
Okay sounds good
at breakfast?
No judgment
Sounds delicious 
Good plan
When you ordered the yeti were you able to get it right then?
At the flagship? 
Ah okay. A dude at the counter told me they don't have the etching equipment there 
Just quoting the dude
I didn't want etched either Gaga
Haha
Just curious 
I wanted just custom college
I'll just do online I guess
Oh no it's okay! I was going by and went in to check it out regardless
Oh not a problem 
I was going there anyway to check it out
And was already in that area
I don't think I'll be able to this weekend üòï
But is 7 ok still?
Have headphones for you
If you want
If not I'll leave them in a locked
Locker
Nah you good 
I'll bring them out in a second
Yep no problem
Hopping on an elliptical to warm up just grab em when you're out
üôåüèº
hadn't seen that yet
Nice
Thank yyyooouuuuuuuuuuuuu
 What room?
Ah
Yeah 
Can meet at zilker after yalls party thing
Hm
I guess it depends on when I leave work
I'll probably be done by 6:15 at the very very latest
That'd be fine as long as I'm out of work before 5
I'm sure it'll all work out fine not too concerned 
What's the verdict on your back
üëçüèº
Probably going to the gym ~5:15/30
Kk
hah
Yeah I'll be there in a bit pulling out of my driveway
This is fucking absurd
The traffic on the way to work is going to blow
üòê
Yee
Or everyone will work from home 
I should've thought to wear different shoes
My feet are wet
!!!!!
smol
Ooh
Interesting
Yeah it's rampant
üòï
strugs
 trrruuueee
sad though- had a massage scheduled for tonight but the AC at the location broke and I had to reschedule. Tragic
indeed
time to just go back to the gym I guess üíÅüèΩ
I might. It'll make me feel better I think, better than taking unnecessary pain pills
Yeah true, wouldn't do anything nuts, just enough to sweat and feel ok haha. I would bike outside if it weren't so wet and treacherous 
hey thanks
I try to be careful 
Nah no harder than plenty of people
 I dunno if my knees are good for 4 runs a week but thank you though
Preworkout saves me sometimes 
That counts 
Also I'm definitely going to have to run Saturday morning and not Sunday
If that's ok with you
I genuinely enjoy it

It seems like you do too though
You're doing equally as much
I've had more practice with the multiples a day though
Shit sorry I thought I responded to this.

Nice for both of us to have the accountability 
Also I'm going to work out before work on Wednesday too, massage had to be rescheduled for that evening
i hope so, and if not its all about fun this year
ok cool
ah yeah i saw allies thing. not sure ill be able to do it bc of massage timing
it wouldve been fine if it didnt get rescheduled
ugh
Wouldn't mind that hahah

Oh gosh don't worry
She did not
Oh no
I'd be down! 
Hahah hope so
Just sounds like she has weird ideas of what a good restaurant is
Exactly hahaha
That Safeway is the worst ever also
True, but if you're asking about Indian there's really no scenario in which CPK is the right answer 
Oh shoot just saw it. I'm on my phone so formatting would be wonky but ill check out what you did in the morning

Saw the advice you gave too-- thanks SO much getting an objective eye is critical. And thanks for the kind words, appreciative as always
Ready whenever
Ok
White girls can get more scholarships than just tracing back to the revolution

You just have to be qualified
shoot yeah 
Hm
?
Honey ham

Probably  not blenders had sugar in smoothie today
Breakfast burritos
 Could call ahead
^this is basically on the way
 Just don't know how fast/crowded they are etc
Thanks!! Yeah rough one today,  def going to check this out
Same :/ hate that kind of stuff
Also totally unrelated 
But I'm going to lift Monday morning again
Just went down some stairs barefoot and could, but hopefully by tues should be fine
Hahahah
Yeah foods fab
It's horrific. Absolutely abhorrent 
The racists and bigots have been emboldened by the shithead in office 
My roommates boyfriends best friend died in France in those attacks
It's exactly the same
It needs to be prosecuted as terrorism
Yeah. He was studying abroad in France that semester and was in the wrong place at the wrong time
I mean the car's front was destroyed 
The fact that they were going fast enough to do that much damage indicates zero hesitation 
It makes me sick to my stomach
The fact that someone is so hateful
Yeah. 
"On many sides" 
Ok yes it takes two to tango and both counter and initial protesters were in skirmishes
But yet who had the fucking car
I'm sure it's a combination of both of these things-- the current times and the fact that we're just now entering the world and realizing it's not all rainbows
But like this is jarring. For me at least 
But it's really horrible realizing how widespread the ignorance and hate is
It's really not about fucking economics or jobs or bringing back coal jobs. It's a concern about race and people feeling like they're owed something and have been robbed of some "right" 
Good point. We live in a bubble and it's easy to forget that the majority of this country is vastly less educated
But no. That's a connection that needs to be made
Because that's how it always goes "oh that can never happen here"
Leaders take advantage of people being disgruntled and if can get out of hand very quickly. The mob mentality is real
And the fact that this happened in the quiet sleepy little town of Charlottesville is unnerving. 
Who fucking cares about the statue. It's not about the statue. Y'all have used the issue of the statue as a foot in the door 
I agree with everything ^
The snowball effect is real
Sorry- I'm up but my air pressure warning is back on. Trying to make sure I'm not going to be sitting on a flat
Thanks
Although tbh I'd probably prioritize this over work 
Hopefully it's just low air and I can deal with that later
I'll probably still try to get a full workout in
I'm here anyway
Ok
You don't have to do this though
Seriously
Okay
I haven't gotten a call or anything about my car and just realized I'm not sure how I'm supposed to know when it's done
!!!
smol
floof
bork
Holy shit
It's (attempted) Oklahoma City bombing round 2
üëçüèº
 here whenever you're ready
No worries
Wow
Sorry about that
Do you want to be picked up
Shit sorry
If you want I can get you, I'll just get to work early or something 
üëçüèº
No prob 
Nah don't worry about it
Ok thanks
No worries
Safe travels
Prego
Jeez
At that point you wouldn't even go to work though right
I'm sorry this is such a hassle
Yeah that's the worst
The flight?
Which one
Shut
Shut
SHIT
üòï
Oh you didn't have to do that
Thanks though
No worries, thank you thank you 
Oh good
I actually have a ton to do tonight so I'm going to be heading home right after work, or I would
Sorry üòï
I ran on Sunday though
Did the sprints solo
wasn't pleasant, but did it
Safe travels though hope it's smooth from now on
There's a chance it wouldn't be too terrible around 4
I could see about leaving work early to drive you but it wouldn't be worth going back after
I meant for me
To go back
I can't base it on hours because I leave tomorrow regardless
I feel bad asking to leave early again since I'm already taking Thursday and Friday but I'll see what I can do.
Technically would need to be here until 515 aha
Oh that's not the problem. I feel like it's just not a great impression for me to leave so early on my second-to-last day :/ if I could come back it'd be a completely different story but the traffic going north on 1 just doesn't move in the afternoon

But I don't want you to have to cab
I'm annoyed this whole thing was such a fiasco for you
Touch√©
Hey- sorry for the late response. Right back at you- seriously, don't undersell yourself. 

Thanks again, and best of luck with your last week/drive too!
Oh my gosh, that's actually so sweet of them and so reassuring to hear
Thank you!!!
We'll see about that
You exaggerate
All safe though
nah
and I‚Äôve actually never talked to bob 
did they give you a window?
for accepting
thats awesome though to have
Would you be in atx
I'm sure you could get it moved
Gotchu
Thanks but if I don't I'm not sweating it
Hahaha wow that's excessively high praise
I appreciate it 
But a little over estimating
Hahah oh no need to apologize I appreciate it I just have to get a job first üòÖ
Maybe üò¨
Hahahaha thank you 
Sorry my b
How goes the search for you
They don't usually contact that fast though do they? I wouldn't stress
I'm of the mind I can't control anything so I'm not worrying
Very few publicly accessible ones
Threat assessment is so niche there isn't a publicly accessible one that I know of
Because they're expensive to make
I'd ask your professor
Just google publicly available ones
And if you need access to scholarly ones talk to your professor
Yeah no problem 
Good luck on the corpora search
I don't know what you mean
By that
I mean google n-grams
If you want something online
N-grams are like classic computational ling
